Some useful python scripts for personal use. Feel free to adapt them to your necessities ;)

## List of scripts

### toggle_keyboard.py

Disable/enable notebook's keyboard and touchpad. In addition to Python you will need `xinput` installed in your machine.

My motivation to create this script is because I usually use my notebook in "desktop mode", i.e. with a wireless mouse, keyboard and monitor attached. And my cats simply love walk into my notebook keyboard, causing some confusion sometimes :)

My tip is to assign a key combination to this script. I use CRTL + ALT + K.

WARNING: run this scripts without a wireless keyboard may force you to restart your computer.
